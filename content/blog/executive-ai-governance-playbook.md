## Why governance is now a growth lever

Most organizations treat AI governance as a blocker. High-performing companies treat it as an execution multiplier. The difference is structural: governance should define speed limits, not roadblocks.

## Build a three-layer governance model

1. **Policy layer**: non-negotiable standards for data handling, legal review, and model usage.
2. **Program layer**: initiative prioritization, budget gates, and success metrics.
3. **Delivery layer**: release readiness checks, evaluation baselines, and incident response procedures.

## KPI stack that leadership should own

- Time from concept to production
- Cost per AI-assisted workflow
- Accuracy and quality trend by use case
- Compliance incidents and mitigation lead time

## Final principle

Operational discipline is what turns AI from pilot projects into enterprise leverage.
